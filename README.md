It is a weather app, because everyone knows the universal rule, every developer should have a weather app. :smile:

I will explore the following topics / projects during development:

* Coordinator pattern
* MVVM
* RxSwift
* ReSwift

Once the app reaches an alpha release, I will add extensive documentation or tutorials to explain what I discovered while working on the app.

##Todo

The app is still in the initial development phase. There are many things missing. The following list is just an example to what to expect from this project in the future:

- [ ] Add detailed weather page
- [ ] Add minimal UI
- [ ] Write unit tests
- [ ] Create UI tests
- [ ] Add widgets
- [ ] Include an Apple Watch app
- [ ] Add documentation, tutorials
